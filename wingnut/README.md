Features:
* Every I/O or blocking call lives in async coroutines, yet OpenCV and PyAudio stay in thread‐pools.
* Rich logging across modules lets you tune verbosity (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR).
* No raw threading.Thread, just asyncio tasks and asyncio.run().
* KeywordListener spins until cancellation, firing off asyncio.create_task for each wake‐word.

You can now pytest each component by mocking motors, servos, aiohttp.ClientSession, or cv2.VideoCapture.

Next you might explore:

* Graceful shutdown with asyncio.Event instead of flags.
* A CLI interface (typer or click) to select camera, log‐level, or simulation‐mode.
* Advanced hardware‐in‐the‐loop testing by swapping real devices for async mocks.
* Monitoring dashboards (e.g. aioprometheus) for real‐time metrics on fps, response‐latency, etc.
* Transition to an actor/event‐bus model (aio-pika, pyee) once multiple sensors/actuators need to talk continuously.
